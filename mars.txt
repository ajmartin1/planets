Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
Venus may make a good base for Phoenix due to the heat
An ill-considered change
I'll be able to get 40 extra minutes of beauty rest
Yeti will appreciate the cold
The witches will have no potion ingredients though
The Leviathans will have no humans to eat
